Problem Hypothesis:
The units of an enterprise (production plants, research institutes, users, technical support units, etc.) all produce various quality information, but this information is currently an information silo, and no information sharing benefits have been generated. Now we want to establish an information sharing platform and invite some of the N enterprises to join the platform as members. The enterprises join the platform to incur joining costs, but they can also gain benefits from the information shared by other enterprises. When the rate of return is greater than a given value, enterprises are willing to join, and vice versa. The platform organizer can charge or subsidize members to encourage more members to join, with the goal of maximizing the benefits of the platform. Modeling assumptions:
1. the cost for enterprises to join is fixed, including the labor, meetings, time spent, etc.:
2. the expected benefits that firm i receives from firm j can be positive, negative, or zero, and are unidirectional;
3. enterprises that contribute shared value are invited to join at no cost (subsidies);
4. firms that benefit from shared value may be required to pay a fee;
5. firms are rational and will join when the rate of return is greater than their profitability (but can be disinvited).
